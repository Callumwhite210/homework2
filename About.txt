I started with the basic HTML code
added my stylesheets (Bootstrap)
set up my main body (Header, Footer and the main body)
from there I added the bootstrap nav bar and customized it to my liking 
linked all of my HTML within the folder to the bar
then starting with the "About me" page I started by adding a container and setting up my main image in a column and then added my text in another
then I used a CSS stylesheet to add a background color to the container
then I moved onto the portfolio
I added a container then a background then I added images in columns
then I added a second row with columns
then finally I moved onto the contacts
I used a bootstrap container 
I added a bootstrap form tagg 
then I added my own form box for messages then made is larger then the rest
and finally I added a button to submit
then I added a sticky footer to all of my pages using bootstraps examples
